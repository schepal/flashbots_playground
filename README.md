# Flashbots Playground

This repository showcases several use-cases of the Flashbots relayer service to avoid getting exploited by sniper bots on the Ethereum network. These two examples are adapted from the [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbix_rg-QztSRMn9OBASFwg) created by [Scott Bigelow](https://twitter.com/epheph).

- [Exploting a Smart-Contract with Flashbots](https://github.com/schepal/flashbots_playground/tree/main/exploit-contract): exploit a smart-contract with Flashbots without prematurely revealing this opportunity to other sniper bots.
